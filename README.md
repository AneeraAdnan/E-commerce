# E-commerce
This project is a simple **React e-commerce app** that fetches products from the **Fake Store API**. It includes product listing, dynamic product detail pages with slug-based routing, and a cart system. Users can add items to the cart, update quantities, remove items, and view totals, all managed with **React Context**.
